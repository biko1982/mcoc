<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is a first draft for an alliance-webpage. You will find our vision, a few rules here and the way the alliance is managed. In time I hope to put more information on here, and links to sites that are useful</p>

<h2>Vision</h2>
<p>Have fun, enjoy and play the game and join the stuff you like.</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>
<ol>
<li>Life comes first<br>
But MCOC a close second ;-)</li>
<li>Summoners LVL 20 minimum<br>
Due to the content we aim to play, we need 20+. Sorry for those who aren't there yet, we hope to see you soon!</li>
<li>Play the game<br>
If possible: login at least a few times a week<br>
If not possible: see number 4
</li>
<li>Communicate<br>
A lot is possible, and we have rule 1 as first rule for a reason. But not showing up without a reason means: Exit</li>
<li>Only start what you can finish<br>
If a linked node is to buffed for you to handle: wait until you go in<br>
If you start an AQ or AW, make sure there are enough people to see it through to the end.
</li>
<li>
Maximum 1 AW a week.<br>
Preferably enlistment on Friday, fighting in the weekend
</li>
<li>
No Donations<br>
We don't need your money, we want your enthusiasm.
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Managment ;-)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Active members who are at least level 40 are eligble to become an officer.<br>
An exception to this is Redtiger271, who is an honorary officer and founder of our alliance.</li>
<li>Leader and officers can start AQ and AW. Please do so only if you can comply with rule 5.</li>
</ul>
